ðŸ¥­ Full-Time Caretaker Application Kit

This is a parody job application created in response to a Facebook meme posted by Marwa Elsadat (Ismailia-born, English Translation graduate from Suez Canal University, birthday Aug 1).

The applicant, Raheem (birthday Aug 28 â€” almost birthday twins), decided to apply as her Full-Time Human Caretaker with a mix of humor, flirty compliments, and Ismailia mango diplomacy.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
1. Funny Cover Letter

A tongue-in-cheek professional letter structured like a real job application but packed with jokes, flirty touches, and references to:

Egyptian traffic and resilience training

Netflix intro-skipping expertise

Meme-sharing as a certified skill

Princess treatment (thanks to Raheemâ€™s People & Operations background)

Ismailia mango diplomacy (mangoes still jealous of her beauty)

A one-page rÃ©sumÃ© parody highlighting Raheemâ€™s unusual qualifications:

11 years of tennis â†’ grocery-carrying stamina

Football weekends â†’ teamwork + cardio for errands
